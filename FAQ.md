<details>

<summary>I didn't receive my license after purchase. What should I do?</summary>

</details>

<details>

<summary>My license is expired. What should I do?</summary>

<br />

If your subscription has been canceled or the payment has failed, and the validity period has expired, the license becomes inactive. To reactivate your license, ensure your subscription is active on Stripe.

Once the subscription is active again, the license will be restored automatically.

</details>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

<details>

<summary>How do I export my CSS variables?</summary>

<br />

Go to the Export tab, select a collection and mode, preview the CSS, then either copy it to your clipboard or download a ZIP containing all the CSS files.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Some variables aren't exporting properly. What's happening?</summary>

<br />

The plugin applies transformations to ensure CSS validity:

- Slashes (/) are replaced with hyphens (-).
- Numeric variables (FLOAT) automatically append the px unit.
- CSS variables are sorted alphabetically.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I export multiple collections at once?</summary>

<br />

For the download option, all selected collections are exported at once in a ZIP file. For the copy-to-clipboard option, only one mode of a collection is copied. To export multiple modes or collections, use the Git Deployment feature to choose specific collections and modes.

</details>

## üåê Git Deployment (Premium)

<details>

<summary>How do I enable Git deployment?</summary>

<br />

First, purchase a license directly through Figma and activate it in the plugin's Settings tab. Then, create a Git provider under the Settings tab. After that, go to the Deploy tab, select your provider from the list, choose the collection modes to export, and click the "Push" button to deploy.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I can't add a Git provider. What should I check?</summary>

<br />

Ensure your personal access token is valid and has the necessary permissions and the user/organization name, repository and branch are correct. For self-hosted GitLab, include the host URL `mycustomgitlab.com`.

Check resources:

- [Github Personal Access Token documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-token)
- [Gitlab Personal Access Token documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/profile/personal_access_tokens)

</details>

<details>

<summary>My push to Git fails. How can I fix it?</summary>

<br />
Troubleshoot with these steps:

- Check that the token has sufficient write permissions
  Verify the branch exists (the plugin will create it automatically if permissions allow)
- Ensure the repository URL and provider details are correct
- Confirm that the selected collections and modes are not empty

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I push to specific branches?</summary>

<br />

Yes, you can specify the target branch in the provider settings. If the branch doesn't exist, the plugin will create it automatically.
